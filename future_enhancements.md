# ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

While our project successfully implemented **real-time GIF retrieval and display**, we identified **key areas** that could further improve the **user experience**.

---

## ðŸ—£ **Voice Command Integration with Alexa**
A **major enhancement** would be to integrate **Alexa voice commands** for **GIF searching and selection**. Users could **verbally request a GIF**, and the system would:
1. **Process the voice command** via AWS Alexa Skills.
2. **Translate the request** into a search query for **Giphy API**.
3. **Display the selected GIF** on the OLED screen.

ðŸ“Œ **Potential Expansion**:  
- **Send GIFs to another userâ€™s OLED screen remotely** via **AWS IoT**.
- **Enable voice-controlled navigation** through **GIF categories**.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Interface & Navigation Enhancements**
The **current system** relies on a **TV remote** for navigation. To improve usability:
- Implement a **graphical menu system** on the **OLED display**.
- Add **a search history** feature, allowing users to **quickly reselect past GIFs**.
- Improve **on-screen GIF titles & metadata** for better browsing.

---

## ðŸŽž **Optimized GIF Animation Handling**
To further **enhance playback smoothness**, we plan to:
- Implement **double buffering** to **preload frames** before displaying.
- Fully utilize **DMA transfers** to **offload pixel rendering** from the CPU.
- Cache **recently accessed GIFs** to **reduce redundant AWS requests**.
